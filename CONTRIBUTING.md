## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the `README.md` to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

## Coding Style Guidelines

*   We follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code.
*   Use type hints for all function signatures.
*   Write docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions.
*   Use a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` to check your code for style issues.
